Welcome! 👋  
Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge solution.

Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. This project was a great opportunity for me to practice HTML, CSS, and layout techniques.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  

I used a mobile-first workflow and modern CSS features like Flexbox and CSS Grid to match the design.

You can use any tools you like for these challenges, so I experimented with React and Next.js in my workflow, along with Styled Components for styling.

## Where to Find Everything

All the project designs are in the `/design` folder. There are mobile and desktop versions in JPG format. I used these as references to implement layout, spacing, and typography.  

The `/assets` folder contains all the required images already optimized for web use.

## My Process

1. **Planning:** I reviewed the designs carefully and planned the HTML structure for reusable components.  
2. **HTML Structure:** I wrote semantic HTML first to ensure the page was well-structured.  
3. **Styling:** I started with base styles like font-family, font-size, and color palette. Then I added layout styles section by section.  
4. **Responsive Design:** I made sure the page looked good on both mobile and desktop devices using media queries.  
5. **Deployment:** Finally, I deployed the project on GitHub Pages for a live version.

## What I Learned

This project taught me how to:

- Structure HTML semantically for a recipe page.  
- Use Flexbox and Grid effectively for layout.  
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first techniques.  
- Deploy a project using GitHub Pages.  

## Continued Development
Next, I want to focus on:

Adding more interactivity with JavaScript or React.

Improving accessibility across the page.

Experimenting with CSS animations for a more dynamic UI.
